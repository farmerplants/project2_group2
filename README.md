### The goal with this project was to forecast solar energy supply using three distinct forecasting models: 
#### Time Series and Regression Analysis
#### ARIMA
#### LSTM
### With further model enhancements, future potential applications could include: blockchain enabled microgrids for small communities, reducing costs while promoting renewable electricity and energy storage options, small community grid consultation.
